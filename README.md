My contributions to the project since last assignment submission
•	Text Data Contribution
•	Semantic Analysis
•	Language Models Integration
•	Leveraging FastAPI's efficient framework, I developed robust connections between FastAPI and MongoDB, enabling seamless interaction between the web application and the database.
•	Through diligent implementation, I ensured that data retrieval, storage, and manipulation processes between FastAPI and MongoDB were optimized for performance and reliability, adhering to best practices in both web development and database management.
•	Additionally, I integrated FastAPI with Streamlit, enriching the user experience by enabling real-time data visualization and interaction through intuitive web interfaces.
•	By combining the strengths of FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities with Streamlit's dynamic frontend functionalities, I crafted a comprehensive solution that empowers users to interact with data stored in MongoDB through a user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall usability and functionality of the application.
•	Also we successfully completed the establishment of connections between the whole triangle model with our teamwork.
•	As a part of this assignment, I did the technical report for the Project.
•	As a part of this assignment, I did the summary report for the Project.

Project milestones, challenges, and next steps

We have set up the database. Tested the wav2vec model to run in python. Set up the connections from the database to Streamlit to the Wav2vec , thus completing the triangle model for our project.
Challenges until now was database set up and model implementation through python, which took a lot of time and were finally managed.
Next steps will be to integrate LLaMA and LLaVA in the project by implementing them through python code. And start fine-tuning the models with our datasets.
